Getting familiar with Github
I am Jonathan Gurr, a programmer-to-be. I am actively seeking to become a programmer, although not at the pace I'd like to because I'm trying to juggle multiple different things at the moment like college, finding a job, and finishing my 2-year mission. However, I find that programming has already turned into the thing I do when I get distracted and want to have some fun. It's something that motivates me and makes me want to learn and apply my knowledge and learn some more. I really have enjoyed it quite a bit!
My plan is to get at least an Associate's degree in Computer Science--possibly a bachelor's. It all depends on how quickly I can get some real-life experience. That's something I've observed by looking at other programmers.
